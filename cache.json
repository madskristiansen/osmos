We remove atmospheric carbon dioxide and trap it in materials that are used to make cement.

The world is addicted to concrete, so this problem is not going away. We make synthetic limestone using atmospheric CO2, such that when it is used to make cement, the process is carbon neutral.\nWe were both master's students in engineering at Oxford University in the UK.
