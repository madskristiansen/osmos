          "description": "https://github.com/denvaar/pgdiff\nI cobbled together various programs into a bash script to compare how data changes between two points in time. My idea was basically to have a `git diff` but for data inside postgres.\nI wanted a util like this to help get to know a new code base: Interact with an app and watch how the data changes.\nYou run the script with a given key (anything) before interacting with an app, then run it again with the same key to see the data diff.\nI'm not much of a bash scripter, as you can probably see from the script, but it was a fun and useful tool to make. Might make some more improvements in the future (eg. BYO diff command, etc.) but we'll see.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28175845\nPoints: 12\n# Comments: 1",
