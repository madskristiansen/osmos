We’re building a place for companies, resellers, and distributors to work together to bid on government contracts.\nThe U.S. government buys lots of things.

The problem is, it's super confusing to participate in the market.\nYou have to understand the rules, have the right connections to government contractors, have a record of strong performance selling to the government, and usually a sales force focused specifically on government sales. This friction leads to fewer companies (especially smaller companies) participating, less competition, and ultimately the government buying the loudest or most insider-connected products instead of the best or mos…",
