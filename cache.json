          "description": "Hello HN crowd.\nI worked on this project on weekends and evenings. I'm excited I made it into a presentable MVP, and it is so satisfying.\nI would like to get some honest feedback from this great community.\nI made https://freeoptionscreener.com/, to scratch a personal itch. I myself trade options as a hobby, and I didn't find a screener that satisfies my need to be able to explore raw options data freely and without preset constraints. So I made this app that allows playing with options market data and extract interesting opportunities.\nThe techs used:\n- Laravel + Jquery + Mysql\n- Tradier API for market data \n- DigitalOcean for hosting\n- OVH for domain name\nIt costs me 5$/month to run the website. I'll be glade to continue if it proves to be a viable product in the long run and maybe I will take it to the next level and try monetize it.\nNote: the app is not suitable for phone screens yet, although this is a planned feature.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28320346\nPoints: 166\n# Comments: 67",
