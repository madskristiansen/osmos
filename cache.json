          "description": "Hi HN, we're Zain and Grant at Keyri (https://keyri.co/). We make a white label passwordless authentication SDK that companies can embed into their mobile apps for instant biometrics-based registration and login on any device. Keyri can be used for (1) authentication by itself, (2) an auth option in addition to passwords and OpenID, (3) step-up identity verification in high risk-score scenarios.\nPasswords suck - they're terrible for security and terrible for ease of use. 2FA solutions are clunky and still insecure - for example, SMS-based 2FA doesn't work when you travel abroad, and it can be defeated with phishing and SIM swapping. They also allow users to share their subscription accounts with others, robbing companies of revenue. Password-based auth also enables the sort of bot activity…",

We're building spacecraft to remove orbital debris and provide services to existing satellites.\nOrbital debris poses a significant risk to mankind's future in space. There are currently over 250k objects in space that would destroy a satellite if a collision were to occur. Large uncontrolled objects like depleted rocket upper stages and dead satellites pose the greatest risk because of the potential to break upon impact with small debris into thousands of smaller pieces. There is currently no system in operation that can deorbit large amounts of space debris. If this problem is not addressed in the next 5-10 years, it could render entire orbits unusable for generations.\nOur spacecraft (which …",
