I (Rachita) am a bioengineer and cardiologist specializing in heart rhythm disorders, and Kunj is a pain physician with a Masters in applied mathematics. We make life-saving ECG software to replace a 3-day hospitalization and let patients start heart meds safely at home.\n34M people have atrial fibrillation (AFib), the most common heart rhythm disorder in the world. It causes 1 in 4 strokes in people over 40 and increases the risk of death by 4x. Antiarrhythmic meds improve symptoms and save lives. Unfortunately, these pills can only be started during a 3+ day hospitalization because early drug trials showed $26B in the US alone, 75% of which is for hospitalizations.\nAs a cardi…",

We allow lending companies to trade their loan receivables into upfront working capital that gets them off the ground and grows with them as they scale.\nBuilding a lending company is challenging because it requires a lot of capital to get started. You need lending history to access capital, but you can’t access capital until you have a history of lending. To get around this, founders traditionally raise a large dilutive equity round and then lend off their balance sheet, or they find a family office or credit fund willing to offer a loan, which usually comes with high interest rates, warrants, and covenants. Even once your company succeeds in reaching the scale necessary to secure a traditional loan, the proces…",
