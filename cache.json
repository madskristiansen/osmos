We enable automatic merges for your Github Pull Requests, based on configurable rules you can set for each repo. These automated merges ensure you never have failing builds on master/main and save time on rebasing your feature branches.\nIf you have a monorepo where a big engineering team is regularly merging changes, the stability of the main branch degrades considerably. This happens because more engineers working on the same codebase introduce incompatible changes, causing builds to break even though their commits pass independently. Here’s an example: https://blog.mergequeue.com/managing-github-merges-for-high-....\nGithub has a setting to restrict branches to be up to date before merging, but turning on tha…",
