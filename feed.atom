        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[TL;DR: Consider listing your contact details in your HN profile!
There are lots of interesting conversations happening here on HN. But sometimes people might want to continue the discussions even after threads fall of the front page.
Have you considered listing your contact details on HN so that people can get in touch with you more easily?
If you want to do that, please note that it’s not enough to fill in the email field on your profile. Only the HN admins can see that field.
If you want others to see your e-mail address etc, you need to explicitly put it in the about text area.
Some members want to keep a low profile and I certainly respect that. But please consider what you might be missing. There’s also no requirement to use your main e-mail address. One could also use an alternative e-mail in order to stay pseudonymous.
There are just so many interesting people here so I thought that one might not want to miss out on all interesting connections that could occur. For example, interesting job offers are not uncommon here.
Just my 2¢ though, do what thou wilt. Peace!

        <id>https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28009972</id>
        <link href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28009972"/>
        <updated>2021-07-30T16:59:52.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I'm Ishita, cofounder of Matrubials (https://matrubials.com/). We are developing milk-derived therapeutics to address infectious diseases.
I have extensive experience in microbiology and infectious diseases in both academia and industry. Taken together, our founding team has ~100 years of combined experience in microbiology and ecology, food science and chemistry. My cofounders have previously founded other health companies with specialized products (eg. Evolve Biosystems and BCD Bioscience).
We have been focused on structure-function analysis of mammalian milk and the benefits individual components can bring to human health for about two decades. In recent years, we discovered peptides in milk that have selective antimicrobial activity, meaning that they know who the pathogens are, and essentially go after them fast for elimination while bypassing the "good" bugs, leaving them around to continue their jobs. That was the moment we decided we needed to bring these to the market.
One niche in the human body where the imbalance between the good and the bad is really bad, is the human vagina. We've been focusing on specific bacteria that reside in the normal human vagina and those that take over to cause disease. In particular, we hope to reduce the burden of bacterial vaginosis, which remains unresolved with current antibiotics. This is especially important because these infections tend to recur, and can lead to secondary infections and reproductive issues.
Antibiotic discovery is hard, technically and financially. To develop candidate molecules from early stage research to clinically viable products, with efficacy and safety that do better than current standard-of-care, is a major challenge. An opportunity like this one doesn't come around often so we're pretty excited about it.
Converting milk components into therapeutics- now isn't that a great hack? We think so! Happy to hear your thoughts and answer questions!

Even though it seems the president is keeping his promise on freedom of speech, I don't think it would be extravagant to get prepared for the worse.
So, what should I do to keep myself safe online?
Edit: I'm not worried about my physical safety, I'm just asking about protecting my privacy online if the government decides to go full on Big Brother.
P.S.: I tried to submit this question with a throwaway account, for obvious reasons, was told to "please slow down".

We do this by using details about the home to provide upfront, guaranteed prices and instant scheduling, with work completed by a network of qualified professionals. We’re starting with hot water heater replacements and are live in Southern California so far.
Many homeowners struggle to find contractors who will provide quality work without gouging them on price. They burn hours of time contacting pros and hosting onsite scoping visits, just to get prices and availability—with little insight on quality. Lead generation platforms like Angi and Thumbtack only solve a narrow slice of the problem - finding pros - without helping to price, schedule,…]]></summary>
